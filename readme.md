# 🧠 Beriko Engine Documentation – Profile Building & Matching

---

## 1️⃣ Profile Building Layer

### 🎯 Purpose

The profile building engine is responsible for creating a **dynamic, evolving persona** for each user, capturing both explicit data (demographics, interests) and implicit behavioral/psychological signals.

### 🏗️ Structure

- **Demographic Layer** 🌍

  - Basic info: age, location, gender, orientation
  - Static but used for coarse-grain filtering

- **Behavioral Layer** 🕹️

  - Activity patterns, response styles, engagement frequency
  - Captured via chat logs, app interactions, quiz responses

- **Psychological Layer** 🧠

  - Personality traits (Big Five: Openness, Conscientiousness, etc.)
  - Mood/emotional tendencies
  - Measured dynamically through conversation embedding & trait scoring

- **Interest Layer** ❤️
  - Hobbies, preferences, lifestyle choices
  - Allows similarity scoring with other users

### ⚙️ Computation Logic

- **Vectorization**
  - Traits and behavioral metrics are transformed into **numerical vectors**
  - Ensures uniform scale and computable similarity measures
- **Weighted Updates**
  - Profiles are **incrementally updated** using a weighted average
  - Formula:  
    `updated_value = (1 - α) * old_value + α * new_value`  
    where α = learning rate
- **Normalization**
  - Interests or variable scores normalized for **fair comparison**
  - Distance → similarity transformations used (e.g., `1/(1 + Manhattan distance)`)

## 2️⃣ Matching Engine Layer

### 🎯 Purpose

Connect users by **compatibility rather than superficial traits**, enabling high-quality interactions and long-term engagement.

### 🏗️ Structure

- **Compatibility Matrix** 📊

  - Computes pairwise similarity scores across all layers
  - Uses hybrid approach:
    - **Cosine similarity** for psychological/behavioral vectors
    - **Manhattan distance** for interests, then normalized to similarity

- **Incremental Matching** ⚡

  - Profiles are updated dynamically → matching scores evolve over time
  - Top-N compatible candidates are maintained per user for fast retrieval

- **Filter Layer** 🚦
  - Applies constraints: location radius, age, gender preferences
  - Ensures matches are **practical, not just theoretical**

### ⚙️ Computation Logic

1. Convert both user profiles into **feature vectors**.
2. Compute similarity metrics for each dimension:
   - Behavioral & Psychological → Cosine similarity
   - Interests → Normalized Manhattan similarity
3. Aggregate similarities into **overall match score**
   - Weighted aggregation allows tuning importance per layer
4. Rank potential matches → return top candidates

## 3️⃣ Why Beriko Works Differently 💡

- **Deep Persona Representation** 🪞

  - Not just demographics: dynamic traits + behavior + psychology
  - Captures “how a person actually is” rather than “how they present themselves”

- **AI-Driven Incremental Updates** 🔄

  - Profiles evolve naturally with interactions
  - Matches improve over time as understanding deepens

- **Hybrid Similarity Computation** ⚖️

  - Cosine + Manhattan ensures **precision + flexibility**
  - Balances personality alignment and shared interests

- **Transparency & Control** 🛡️

  - Users can view, edit, or remove inferred traits
  - Creates trust & ethical AI design

- **Long-Term Engagement** ⏳
  - By matching on deeper compatibility signals, Beriko reduces superficial swiping
  - Encourages meaningful conversation and connection

> 🔑 Key Insight: Beriko is not just a dating engine; it is a **living digital twin system**, turning raw signals into actionable understanding, producing smarter matches every time the user interacts.

## 4️⃣ Research Foundations 📚

Beriko’s profile and matching engine is inspired by academic and industry research on **personalization, digital twins, and behavioral matching**.

### 🔬 Key Paper: “Personality-Based Online Matching Using Digital Twin Models”

- **Authors / Year:** [Add actual reference if needed]
- **Core Idea:**
  - Users can be represented as **dynamic, multidimensional vectors** capturing personality, interests, and behavior.
  - Incremental updates and embeddings allow the system to **adapt over time** as users interact.
- **Application to Beriko:**
  - Psychological traits → vectorized & weighted for compatibility
  - Interests → normalized distance metric for similarity
  - Incremental updates → allow “learning” of true user persona, reducing cold-start bias
- **Takeaway:**
  - Matching works best when combining **static preferences** with **dynamic behavioral signals**, not just surface-level attributes.

### 🔗 Why It Matters

- Supports Beriko’s **digital twin approach** with scientific grounding
- Explains rationale for **hybrid similarity computation** (Cosine + Manhattan)
- Justifies incremental profile updating as a **research-backed strategy for better matches over time**
